**Title:** "Modulation of Photomorphogenesis in Spaceflight Alters Root System Architecture in WT Col causing dwarfing effect that is not observed but not in Col-0-_phyD_ and WS Mutants: New Insights from Deep Learning using images from ABRS and CARA mission".

**Abstract:**&#x20;

Photomorphogenesis and auxin transport are important processes that regulate root growth in plants. We investigated the role of these processes in root growth in microgravity by growing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in spaceflight or ground control conditions under light or dark conditions. Root growth was measured at various time points. RNA sequencing was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the spaceflight and ground control conditions. Mathematical modeling was used to simulate the effects of auxin transport on root growth. Our results showed that root growth was significantly reduced in spaceflight compared to ground control conditions for WT Col-0, but this reduction in root growth was more pronounced in seedlings that were grown under light conditions. RNA sequencing identified a number of genes that were differentially expressed in the spaceflight vs ground control conditions in both light and dark grown samples. These genes included genes involved in auxin transport, sucrose/GA transport, photomorphogenesis, and cell signaling revealing that the addition of light enables more cellular and molecular adaptations to the effects of spaceflight. Mathematical modeling using PIN protein expression changes showed that the reduction in auxin accumulation in columella and lateral root caps of spaceflight samples explain the changes in root length and diameter. These results suggest that photomorphogenesis and auxin transport play important roles in root growth in microgravity. The reduction in auxin transport in spaceflight may be due to a number of factors, including changes in the cytoskeleton and cell wall structure. The results of this study have implications for the design of future plant-based life support systems for long-duration spaceflight.

**Introduction to plant tropisms:** Plants have evolved to grow and develop in the presence of gravity. However, when plants are grown in microgravity, their growth and development can be altered. This is because gravity plays an important role in a number of plant processes that include auxin transport including gravitropism, thigmotropism, chemotropism, oxytropism and hydrotropism.

**Introducing Auxin transport and the importance of gravity for polarity:** Auxin is a plant hormone that is involved in a wide range of developmental processes, including root growth, stem elongation, and leaf development. Auxin is transported from the shoot to the roots in a polar fashion, meaning that it is transported in a unidirectional manner. This polar transport is important for the development of a plant's root system.

**Gravitropism is the ability of plants to grow in response to a gravity vector:** Gravitropism is mediated by a number of factors, including auxin transport. When a plant is placed in a gravitational field, auxin is redistributed in the plant providing polarity in ion movement. This redistribution of auxin causes the plant to grow in a direction that is perpendicular to the gravitational field.

**Hydrotropism is the ability of plants to grow in response to water gradient:** Hydrotropism is mediated by a number of factors, including auxin transport. When a plant is placed in a water gradient, auxin is redistributed in the plant. This redistribution of auxin causes the plant to grow in the direction of the water gradient.

**Magnitude of tropisms are affected by microgravity:** Studies of effects of microgravity on a number of plant processes have provided evidence broadly links changes to auxin signaling and transport as being the primary mechanism for plants to adapt to spaceflight and the stresses related to spaceflight potentially indicating that they may be using part of their gravitropic response machinery to response to the stressors of spaceflight such as localized regions of hypoxia.

**Introducing system biology** In recent years, the application of systems biology and mathematical modeling to plant biology has grown rapidly. _Arabidopsis thaliana_ has emerged as a model system for these investigations due to its small genome and well-understood genetics. Many tools have been developed that allow researchers to use mathematical models to generate new and test old hypotheses.

Note: Original paper incorrectly labels the _phyD_ mutants as being in the WS ecotype background, however, it is actually in the Col background.

In this study, we investigate the role of the PIN auxin transporter during spaceflight and translate environmental signals, such as light or dark, into changes in growth patterns. Additionally, we use mathematical modeling to study the effects of this transporter on Arabidopsis growth patterns during the CARA mission.

MAYBE using the data on PhyB, PhyA in Ler background (vs Col0) may be interesting (SEEDLING GROWTH missions?).RH

**Methods:**

RNASeq data from CARA processed by NASA **GeneLab provide many interactive data visualization options** [https://visualization.genelab.nasa.gov/data/GLDS-120](https://visualization.genelab.nasa.gov/data/GLDS-120)

**Reanalysis of RNAseq:** The CARA (GLDS-120) experiments including RNAseq using the GeneLab data visualization system to observe gene expression provides new insights into hormonal changes caused by the addition of light that enable new and novel metabolic adaptations.

**Mathematical modeling of auxin transport**: to investigate the role of the PIN transporters in Arabidopsis auxin distribution patterns during spaceflight. The expression levels of the PIN proteins were used to provide conductivity values to the cell walls where they’ve been shown to be expressed (See Table X for PIN protein tissue specific pattern summary), using python jupyter notebook.

**Reanalysis of images from LSDA:** Images were downloaded from ALSDA, aligned in adobe bridge image raw, quantified with SmartRoot Fiji plugin, plotted with ArchiDart using Rstudio. MNDS and PCA dimensionality reduction was applied.

**Anoxia and hypoxia experiment:** Plants were grown on standard media as described by Choi et al., (XX), plates were then inserted into custom lids with valves attached that allow nitrogen gas to create an anoxic environment for 1, 2, or 3 hours. Plants were images during and after the anoxia treatment using a flatbed scanner recording images at 15min intervals. Nightingale plots were used to plot the direction of growth after hypoxia treatment.

**Describe Auxin Transport modeling:** Our modeling experiment revealed that the PIN transporters are important for adaptation and development of Arabidopsis in spaceflight conditions and show that auxin distribution patterns may help explain physiological phenotypes observed during light. We found that the distribution of auxin in wild-type Arabidopsis (WS) resembles that of the Col-0 _phyD_ mutant during the CARA mission, as described by Paul et al. (2015). Our mathematical modeling revealed that this similarity in auxin distribution patterns may be responsible for the observed changes in growth patterns.

**Prediction from IAA transport modeling: That auxin transport in Col-0-phyD should more closely resemble WS in darkness and to a lesser extend in light.**

The original paper states that there isn’t a reduction in root length in any of the genotypes when all treatments are considered. Interestingly if the light and dark treatments are separated then the Col-0 root are shorter in flight when grown in light and the _phyD_ roots have increased diameter in flight when grown in dark. These are 2 previously unseen phenotypes that may provide some clues about the potential influence of photomorphogenesis on plant architecture in microgravity. RNAseq shows upregulation of photosynthetic machinery, to increase the thylakoid number, may increase the efficiency of the dark reaction to process by products of anaerobic respiration and may even enable the roots to perform photosynthesis.

The effect of spaceflight on the gravity-sensing auxin gradient of roots: GFP reporter gene microscopy on orbit…“examined the spaceflight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana: pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1-GFP, pSCR::SCR-GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically "vertical" distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes.”

**Taken together these data show the Col-0 **_**phyD**_** mutant root system architecture more closely resembles WS.**

**Col-**_**phyD**_** and WS have similar auxin transport patterns and this is reflected in the similarity of their root system architecture.**

Follow up experiments (Figure X,X) show response to anoxia assays show low oxygen can effect root length and growth trajectory. There is ecotype variation in the plants response to low oxygen and it is interesting to note that WS exhibit large skews in response to changes in oxygen availability and this may potentially be the cause of the skewing root behavior observed during the ABRS mission (GLDS-7). In addition, these data also show that Ler has a left handed skew in response to low oxygen, a phenotypic response previously observed in the BRIC17 (Johnson et al., xx) and in the EMCS TROPI study (Vanderbrink et al., XX)

**Conclusion**:

The presence of light powers a circadian transport of Auxin in the root tip following the reverse fountain model (Swarup et al., 205), the photomorphogenesis enables a plethora of adaptive responses to spaceflight. The secondary biproducts of roots metabolism, microgravity induced root photosynthesis has the potential to change the root morphology making them growth either shorter or wider in diameter. The results of these studies have shown that microgravity can have a significant impact on plant growth and development. This is important information for scientists who are developing plant-based life support systems for long-duration spaceflight.

**Final model idea?…**. Does it need a protein-protein interaction model?-> could GPEC to pull some nodes from CARA?

How is the change in phytochrome dependent signaling during in plant experiencing spaceflight with light on their roots experiencing a reduction in growth, but if they have a Col-_phyD_ mutation then the root increases in diameter?

RNAseq shows -> something to do with sucrose transporters ;-)

The papers suggest that oxygen affects auxin transport in Arabidopsis roots by regulating the expression and activity of auxin transporters. Gälweiler 1998 found that the PIN1 gene encodes a protein that acts as a transmembrane component of the auxin efflux carrier in vascular tissue. Casimiro 2001 showed that the auxin transport inhibitor NPA blocks basipetal IAA movement from the root tip, which is critical for lateral root initiation. Marchant 1999 demonstrated that the AUX1 protein facilitates auxin uptake within root apical tissues, and regulates root gravitropism by co-ordinating the localized redistribution of auxin within the Arabidopsis root apex. Finally, Ljung 2005 identified an important auxin source in the meristematic region of the primary root tip as well as in the tips of emerged lateral roots, and showed that root-localized IAA synthesis is diminished in a cyp79B2 cyp79B3 double knockout. Overall, these findings suggest that oxygen affects auxin transport in Arabidopsis roots by regulating the expression and activity of auxin transporters, which in turn affects various aspects of root development.
