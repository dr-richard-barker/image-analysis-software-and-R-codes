# AstroRoot Modelling plan

**Goal:** Understand what Arabidopsis roots system architecture SpaceFlight vs Ground control is telling us about the space flight environment.&#x20;

**Hypothesis:** Hypoxia will cause the roots to increase in diameter. ROS-induced transverse cell division will lead to the formation of new cell files (see STOMAGEN  Ler-0 storyboard).

**Issue:** The number of samples from spaceflight is limited.&#x20;

**Produce ground truth datasets:** Grow Arabidopsis with a range of environmental factors that resemble aspects of spaceflight. &#x20;

**Variable Phenotypes:** Insertion angle (micropyle orientation): this is random for Arabidopsis but direction for cotton.

**Tropism parameter 1**: determines the variability of the angle… (this is like the auxin / circadian spiral, as this influences asymmetric cell divisions, aka the final number of tissues in a root, will determine the amount of twisted growth. Thus, adding another cell layer will increase the variability of the angle. So stress-induced cell layers increase horizontal root growth-induced pivot/ reorientation and thus increase root directional plasticity).&#x20;

**Tropism parameter 2:** the distance is can go (elongation)

**Root Radius:** determined by swelling in the elongation zone (GA/JA/Ethylene)

**Root length:** Directional Phototropic influence: unknown ‘downward’ angle variance&#x20;
