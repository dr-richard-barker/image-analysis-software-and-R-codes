The CPIB RootNav software has an extra feature allowing it to measure root skewing. The CPIB RootTrace software folder contains the extra .dll required to make it function.

This repositry also contain a statisical analysis repositry deisnged to make plant image analysis easier. These codes were developed in collaboration with Ralph Møller Trane. The bar plot code development continued and led to the creation of these two R-shiny websites.

In addition, these R-shiny sites were also found to be useful for creating Venn diagrams http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/jvenn/example.html Philippe Bardou, Jérôme Mariette, Frédéric Escudié, Christophe Djemiel and Christophe Klopp. jvenn: an interactive Venn diagram viewer.
