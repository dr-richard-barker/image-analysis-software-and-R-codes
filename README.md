# Introduction

**AstroBotany Calibration Stickers:**

A consistent calibration source is crucial for accurate image analysis. We developed the Astrobotany spectrum sticker \[link to Astrobotany spectrum sticker] specifically to address this challenge and make image analysis more accessible: \[[https://astrobotany.com/product/airi-bio-imaging-spectrum-5cm/](https://astrobotany.com/product/airi-bio-imaging-spectrum-5cm/)].

**Image Analysis Tutorials and Tools:**

While a comprehensive automated analysis tutorial is still in the works, here are some resources that might be a good starting point:

* **Space Photography Guide:** This guide by Dr. Richard Barker offers tips on planning your biological photography: \[[https://dr-richard-barker.github.io/Space\_Photography\_Guide.io/](https://dr-richard-barker.github.io/Space\_Photography\_Guide.io/)].
* **SpaceChile\_phenotyping notebook:** This Python code prototype explores image segmentation for plant detection using the PlantCV package: \[[https://github.com/dr-richard-barker/image-analysis-software-and-R-codes/blob/master/SpaceChile\_phenotyping\_v1.ipynb](SpaceChile\_phenotyping\_v1.ipynb) on GitHub].
* **Web-glyphics App:** This web application by Lvbauer utilizes the Astrobotany calibration sticker for image analysis (code available on GitHub): \[[https://web-glyphics.streamlit.app/](https://web-glyphics.streamlit.app/)], \[[https://github.com/lvbauer/web-glyphics](https://github.com/lvbauer/web-glyphics)], \[[https://github.com/lvbauer/web-glyphics/blob/main/func/airisquare.py](https://github.com/lvbauer/web-glyphics/blob/main/func/airisquare.py)].

Streamlit Apps (Under Development):

We're also developing user-friendly Streamlit apps to simplify image analysis without requiring coding. Here are some examples currently in progress:

* Plant Detection App: \[[https://viva-fidel-planet-main-n4sviq.streamlit.app/](https://viva-fidel-planet-main-n4sviq.streamlit.app/)]
* Plant Health Classification App: \[[https://drplantclassifier.streamlit.app/](https://drplantclassifier.streamlit.app/)]
* Plant Cross Section Quantification App: \[[https://nathanpouliquen-projet-m1-automated-analysis-app-it8h6s.streamlit.app/](https://nathanpouliquen-projet-m1-automated-analysis-app-it8h6s.streamlit.app/)]

This repo contains folders full of images including Azola, Lemna, Londultia and Wolfinia.&#x20;

It also contains a folder with everything needed to run the "Germinator" software.

There are also a folders that contain the RootNav, RootTrace, and RootTraceV2 software.&#x20;

There is python notebooks for running analysis with cellpos2.0.

There is also a python notebook for spectrum, CARA, flashlapse ("Guage\_growth"), and other PlantCV ruse examples.&#x20;
